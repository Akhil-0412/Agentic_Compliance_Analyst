Additionally, the controller must ensure that, by default, only personal data necessary for each specific purpose of the processing are processed (Art 25(2)).\n\n**Risk/Action**: To comply with data protection by design, controllers should take a proactive approach to integrate data protection principles into their processing operations, considering the state of the art, cost of implementation, and nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing, as well as the risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons (Art 25(1)). This may involve implementing measures such as pseudonymisation, data minimization, and ensuring that personal data are not made accessible without the individual's intervention to an indefinite number of natural persons (Art 25(2)).\n\nConfidence: 0.9"
